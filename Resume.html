          <p>
            During my time as a Team Leader, I managed to get some skills in
            Leadership. To create teams and lead them was not easy, but I
            managed to get the picture. I understood that I need patience,
            envolvement, comunication and knowledge from John C. Maxwell's books
            about leadership.

          <p id="dark-back">
            I've got some technical skills too. I studied at a Construction
            Hi-school, so of course at the end you will know to weel a hammer.
            Than and me working during summer times in contructions made me get
            some skills about everything in that domain. The most satisfying
            thing is to see something build by you, and see it last in time.

          <h3>Computer</h3>
          <p>
            Playing games on a computer doesn't mean that you have computer
            skills. But learning about it and working with it, other than games
            will make you get better day by day. Durring my Hi-school and
            University days i've done some It basic courses. But in 2020 I've
            decided to do some front-end programming with Scoala Informala de
            It.

            Another thing i enjoy doing is driving. At one moment a small car
            wasn't enough so took the Profesional drivinng licence so i can
            drive big trucks. I also have an ambition, to drive every vehicle
            that can be driven and passes my way. Apparently there is a limit
            and not everyone will let you drive what you want.
